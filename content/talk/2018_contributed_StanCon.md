abstract = "The joint modelling of longitudinal and time-to-event data has received much attention in the biostatistical literature in recent years. In this notebook, we describe the implementation of a shared parameter joint model for longitudinal and time-to-event data in Stan. The methods described in the notebook are a simplified version of those underpinning the `stan_jm` modelling function that has recently been contributed to the **rstanarm** R package. This notebook will proceed as follows. In Section 1 we provide an introduction to the joint modelling of longitudinal and time-to-event data, including briefly describing the potential motivations for using such an approach. In Section 2 we describe the formulation of a multivariate shared parameter joint model and introduce it's log likelihood function. In Section 3 we describe some of the more important features of the Stan code required to implement the model. In Section 4 we present a short applied example to demonstrate estimation of the model and the type of inferences that can be obtained. In Section 5 we close with a discussion."
