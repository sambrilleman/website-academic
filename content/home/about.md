# Biography

I am a postdoctoral Research Fellow in biostatistics at the [School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine](https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm) at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. I am also a member of the [Victorian Centre for Biostatistics (ViCBiostat)](http://www.vicbiostat.org.au/). 

I have a keen interest in survival analysis, joint longitudinal-survival models, models for longitudinal data from cohort studies, Bayesian inference, and in the design of Bayesian adaptive clinical trials. My PhD was entitled "Joint longitudinal and time-to-event models: development, implementation and applications in health research" and was supervised by [Prof Rory Wolfe](https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/about/staff/academic/wolfe) (primary), [Dr Margarita Moreno-Betancur](https://www.mcri.edu.au/users/margarita-moreno-betancur), and [Dr Michael Crowther](https://www.mjcrowther.co.uk/). I am a regular user of Stata, R and Stan, and have contributed software packages to the latter two. I have previously worked as both an academic and consultant biostatistician in a number of different roles; my full CV can be found [here](/files/brilleman_cv.pdf).
