# Biography

I currently work as a Principal Data Scientist at [SEEK](https://www.seek.com.au/about/). Our team provides an experimentation platform that is used to test the performance of new AI tools and services being developed at SEEK.

Previously, I worked as an academic biostatistician in several Australian and UK universities; my full CV can be found [here](/files/brilleman_cv.pdf).

I have interests in Bayesian inference, experimental design, survival analysis, and models for longitudinal data from cohort studies. I also enjoy statistical and probabilistic programming. I am a regular user of R and Python. I have contributed to the development of open-source software packages for [R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simsurv/index.html) and [Stan](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstanarm), as well as Python, CI/CD, and cloud-based infrastructure internally at SEEK.

My PhD -- awarded by Monash University in 2018 -- was entitled "[Joint longitudinal and time-to-event models: development, implementation and applications in health research](/files/brilleman_thesis.pdf)" and was supervised by [Prof Rory Wolfe](https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/about/staff/academic/wolfe) (primary), [Dr Margarita Moreno-Betancur](https://www.mcri.edu.au/users/margarita-moreno-betancur), and [Dr Michael Crowther](https://www.mjcrowther.co.uk/).

When not busy crunching data, I have a keen interest in [hiking and travelling](https://www.ultimategearlists.com) around some of the most epic spots on the globe.
